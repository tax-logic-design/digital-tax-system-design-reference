# Educational System Design Framework (Fictional Case Study)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING - EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY

**THIS IS NOT TAX ADVICE. DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION SYSTEMS.**

### 🚨 Disclaimer
This repository contains conceptual design patterns and architectural blueprints for **educational and research purposes only**. The "digital tax" domain is used as a fictional, complex scenario to illustrate universal system design challenges. These materials are not suitable for actual financial or tax determination systems without professional review and adaptation.

### 📚 Purpose
This project documents a comprehensive framework for studying complex, rule-based system architectures. It serves as:
- A learning resource for software architects (Phase-based processing, Determinism).
- A reference for academic research into automated decision engines.
- A starting point for studying Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) and Auditability patterns.

### 🎯 Intended Audience
- Computer science students studying system design.
- Software engineers learning about complex workflow orchestration.
- **NOT**: Businesses seeking tax compliance or legal solutions.

### 📁 Project Structure

This framework is organized into 22 conceptual modules:

* **Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture**
    * `File00 - File02`: Global overview, glossary, and core architecture specifications.
* **Phase 2: Logic, Evidence & Workflow**
    * `File03 - File06`: Evidence preprocessing, quality patterns, and deterministic workflow engine design.
* **Phase 3: Governance & Review**
    * `File07 - File10`: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) patterns, threshold management, and audit readiness.
* **Phase 4: Operational Readiness**
    * `File11 - File14`: Implementation readiness, partner onboarding, and engagement logging.
* **Phase 5: Compliance & Risk Management**
    * `File15 - File18`: Audit simulation, training manual patterns, and risk reporting templates.
* **Phase 6: Quality Assurance & Validation**
    * `File19 - File22`: Design checklists, implementation guidelines, audit log schemas, and regression testing.
